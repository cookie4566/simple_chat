base for code is here: https://pandeyshikha075.medium.com/building-a-chat-server-and-client-in-python-with-socket-programming-c76de52cc1d5
This simple chat is a program that'll connect one or two more clients over any physical media. 
The base is phase one of the program with indiviual testing from friends (subjects) to see if the "copied" code is working :)
phase to will be to use what I leanred from the ip_finda in order to enable multipe clients over physical media to connect to the server, this also, doubles as a stress test on this Mcdonalds wifi of mines.
phase three will be inplementing a GUI system of sorts(no best selection) for ease of use.
phase fo is other application fun.
